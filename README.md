# Farkle
Farkle dice game
This game is designed around the rules I grew up playing from my dad.
I have set it up to allow for up to six players, 5 comps and 1 human.
The rules for the game can be accessed at the start of the game and are fairly long but concise.
A couple files will be works in progress.
For the Game to work correctly, you will need both of the text files because they can be used in the game to explain the rules.

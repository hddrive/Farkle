# Farkle
Farkle dice game
This game is designed around the rules I grew up playing from my dad.
I have set it up to allow for up to six players, 5 comps and 1 human.
The rules for the game can be accessed at the start of the game and are fairly long but concise.
A couple files will be works in progress.
